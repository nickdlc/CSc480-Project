# CSc480-Project
Distributed key generation for a threshold encryption and signature scheme that is "CCA-2 security provable under standard assumptions, distributed key generation, and efficient enough for general use."

**Language:** C++

**Goals:** 

Phase 1: standard distributed key gen

Phase 2: a check to make sure there is no dishonest party

Phase 3:
